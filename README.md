Advanced Data Analysis Group Project by Kuba Bialczyk and Paul Schuhmann.

Dataset: Bitcoin Transaction Data
[View on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shiheyingzhe/bitcoin-transaction-data-from-2009-to-2018)

## Remarks
The analysis was run only on a part of the dataset due to computational limitations on Google Colab Free Tier.

Modelling part (classification) is not extensive, due to small computational resources and lack of coverage of the topics in course curriculum.


## Further analysis
Run the analysis on all available data with the use of distributed computing frameworks like Spark, with larger computational resources available.
